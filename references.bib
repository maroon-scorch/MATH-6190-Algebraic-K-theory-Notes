This leads to a criterion for functors to induce equivalences of K-theory spectra that generalizes and explains many of the criteria appearing in the literature. We show that under mild hypotheses, a weakly exact functor that induces an equivalence of homotopy categories induces an equivalence of K-theory spectra.}

The localization theorem of Quillen [Q1] for K{\textasciiacutex}- or G-theory is the main support of his many results on the G-theory of noetherian schemes. The previous lack of an adequate localization theorem for K-theory has obstructed development of this theory for the fifteen years since 1973. Hence our theorem unleashes a pack of new basic results hitherto known only under very restrictive hypotheses like regularity. These new results include the ``Bass fundamental theorem'' 6.6, the Zariski (Nisnevich) cohomolog-ical descent spectral sequence that reduces problems to the case of local (hensel local) rings 10.3 and 19.8, the Mayer-Vietoris theorem for open covers 8.1, invariance mod ℓ under polynomial extensions 9.5, Vorst-van der Kallen theory for NK 9.12, Goodwillie and Ogle-Weibel theorems relating K-theory to cyclic cohomology 9.10, mod ℓ Mayer-Vietoris for closed covers 9.8, and mod ℓ comparison between algebraic and topological K-theory 11.5 and 11.9. Indeed most known results in K-theory can be improved by the methods of this paper, by removing now unnecessary regularity, affineness, and other hypotheses.",

An assembler has an associated K-theory spectrum, in which π0 is the free abelian group of objects of the assembler modulo the cutting and pasting relations, and in which the higher homotopy groups encode further geometric invariants. The goal of this paper is to prove structural theorems about this K-theory spectrum, including analogs of Quillen's localization and dévissage theorems. We demonstrate the uses of these theorems by analyzing the assembler associated to the Grothendieck ring of varieties and the assembler associated to scissors congruence groups of polytopes.}

    abstract = {Cut-and-paste \$K\$-theory has recently emerged as an important variant of higher algebraic \$K\$-theory. However, many of the powerful tools used to study classical higher algebraic \$K\$-theory do not yet have analogues in the cut-and-paste setting. In particular, there does not yet exist a sensible notion of the Dennis trace for cut-and-paste \$K\$-theory. In this paper we address the particular case of the \$K\$-theory of polyhedra, also called scissors congruence \$K\$-theory. We introduce an explicit, computable trace map from the higher scissors congruence groups to group homology, and use this trace to prove the existence of some nonzero classes in the higher scissors congruence groups. We also show that the \$K\$-theory of polyhedra is a homotopy orbit spectrum. This fits into Thomason’s general framework of \$K\$-theory commuting with homotopy colimits, but we give a self-contained proof. We then use this result to re-interpret the trace map as a partial inverse to the map that commutes homotopy orbits with algebraic \$K\$-theory.},
